## plan:
1. use DLT to initialize and solve with Gauss-Newton; $\textcolor{blue}{done}$
2. use SDR-SDP to initialize and solve with Gauss-Newton or continue to solve with SDR-SDP;$\textcolor{blue}{done, However, result is not so good.} $
3. compare their performances under different level of noises.$\textcolor{blue}{SDR-SDP doesn't outperform others.}$

## plan b:
constellation.

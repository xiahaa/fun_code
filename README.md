## plan:
1. use DLT to initialize and solve with Gauss-Newton; **blue}{done}**
2. use SDR-SDP to initialize and solve with Gauss-Newton or continue to solve with SDR-SDP;**done, However, result is not so good.**
3. compare their performances under different level of noises.**SDR-SDP doesn't outperform others.**

## plan b:
constellation.
